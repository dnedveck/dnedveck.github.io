  <h1>Hi, I'm Derek.</h1>

  <p>I mainly work with the analysis and processing of data. Previously I was a bioinformatician at Spectrum Health in Western Michigan. Before that I was in a doctorate program at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, which I decided to leave in 2017 with a MS in Plant and Microbial Biology.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>mealslurry</h3>

During grad school I developed a framework for eating that I call <a href=http://mealslurry.com> mealslurry</a>. Briefly, it's been optimized for cost, time, mental energy, and nutrition. I've been using it since October 2016, and I've found it to be incredibly helpful in reducing cognitive burden around eating.

<h3>Blog</h3>

<h3>EditR</h3>

<p>
Check out <a href=http://baseeditr.com>the website</a>, the <a href=https://github.com/MoriarityLab/EditR>GitHub repo</a>, and the <a href=https://doi.org/10.1101/213496>bioRxiv.org preprint.</a>
</p>

<p>
I got involved with <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-kluesner-80516589/>Mitch Kluesner's</a> project in developing an algorithm to use Sanger sequencing to quantify the amount of editing in cells modified with <a href=https://benchling.com/pub/liu-base-editor>base editing technology</a>. The amount of editing is normally quantified using Illumina sequencing, costing much more and taking more time than the cheap (~$3 / sample) and fast (1 day) Sanger sequencing method. I refactored Mitch's algorithm in R and wrote a Shiny web app to make it more user friendly and widely available to the community.
